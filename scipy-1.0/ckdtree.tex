The cKDTree module is rewritten in C++ with templated classes.

The support to a box of periodic boundary condition is added. A periodic
condition is typically used in computer simulations of physical processes.

\subsubsection{k-NN}

The API for querying neighbours is enhanced, to allow querying a subset of
k nearest neighbours.

\subsubsection{sparse distance matrix}

generating approximated sparse distance matrix

\subsubsection{Pair-Counting}

The cKDTree module implements the dual tree counting algorithm in (cite).

An improvement to the pair counting algorithm is added to improve the scale
with the number of bins.

\textbf{Add a Figure to show the scaling, before and after.}

The cKDTree can now be augmented by weights. Weighted paircount is essential
in many scientific applications, e.g. computing correlation function of galaxies.

\textbf{perhaps give an example or some formula.}

(cite / mention faster implementions of paircounting algorithms / treecorr, corrfunc)

The main purpose of the paircounting algorithm in cKDTree is to provide a readily
available tool. The KDTree based algorithm is not necessarily the fastest algorithm
depending on the application. E.g. for low number densities a chaining mesh based algorithm
can be easily many times faster than a tree based algorithm.
