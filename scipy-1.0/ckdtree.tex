The cKDTree module was rewritten in C++ with templated classes, and support for
periodic boundary conditions was added. A periodic boundary condition is typically 
used in computer simulations of physical processes.

In 2013, the time complexity of the k nearest neighbor search from
\texttt{cKDTree.query} was approximately loglinear \cite{knn-jake},
consistent with its formal description \cite{kdtree-search-algo}.
Since then, we've enhanced \texttt{cKDTree.query} by reimplementing it in
C++, removing memory leaks, and allowing release of the global interpreter lock (GIL) so that
multiple threads may be used\cite{gh-4374}. This generally improved
performance on any given problem (Figure~\ref{fig:asvbench}) while
preserving the asymptotic complexity (Figure~\ref{fig:knn-complexity}).

In 2015, SciPy added the \texttt{sparse\_distance\_matrix} routine for generating approximate 
sparse distance matrices between \texttt{KDTree} objects by ignoring all distances that 
exceed a user-provided value. Also, this routine allows any Minkowski p-norm between 1 and 
infinity and it is not limited to the conventional L2 (Euclidean) norm. 
By default, the returned data structure is a dictionary of keys (DOK) based sparse matrix, 
which is very efficient for matrix construction. 
This hashing approach to sparse matrix assembly can be 7 times faster than constructing 
with compressed row format (CSR) \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-75755-9_107} and the C++ level 
sparse matrix construction releases the Python GIL for increased performance. 
Once the matrix is constructed, distance value retrieval has an amortized constant time 
complexity \cite{Cormen:2001:IA:580470}, and the DOK structure can be efficiently converted 
to a CSR, CSC or COO matrix to allow for speedy arithmetic operations.

The cKDTree module implements a dual tree counting algorithm\cite{Moore2000ar},
with an improvement to the pair counting algorithm to improve the scaling
with the number of bins. The cKDTree can now be augmented by weights, with 
weighted paircount essential in many scientific applications, e.g. computing 
correlation functions of galaxies\cite{0004-637X-750-1-38}.
